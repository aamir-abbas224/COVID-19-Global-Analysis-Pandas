# COVID-19 Global Analysis

This project uses Python and Pandas to analyse a global COVID-19 dataset. The dataset contains country-wise information such as total cases, new cases, deaths, recoveries, and testing statistics.

### Features
- Read and clean the dataset
- Explore statistics by country and continent
- Simple filtering and column operations

### Notes
- The dataset is already clean; no concatenation or complex grouping was necessary.
- Designed for simple analysis and learning Pandas basics.
- For real-world datasets or more demanding analysis, `groupby` and `concat` may become useful.
